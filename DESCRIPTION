Description: Provides significance controlled variable selection algorithms with different directions (forward, backward, stepwise) based on diverse criteria (AIC, BIC, adjusted r-square, PRESS, or p-value). The algorithm selects a final model with only significant variables based on a correction choice of False Discovery Rate, Bonferroni, or no correction.
